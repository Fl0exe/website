                        IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and WebStorm are my personal Go-To. My daily OS choices range
                        from Arch Linux to macOS, depending on the device. Iâ€™m currently delving into NEXT.js and
                        React.

                    I originally made this site to showcase my skills and projects. (It does that pretty well as you can
                    see.) It also taught me a lot about web-development, git, CI/CD pipelines and Docker.
